No one sets out to become a drug addict. It‚Äôs not like someone wakes up one morning and thinks to himself or herself that they will aspire to tear their lives apart, destroy their goals, or build tolerance for prescription medications and illegal drugs. No one wants to destroy their family's trust, confidence, and support. What people do not understand about drugs and the powerful control they have over life is that they cannot just be stopped.


People try to stop; they want to escape the constant cravings, the drug-seeking behavior, the loss of friends and family, jobs, finances, and the tormenting thoughts. It‚Äôs an exhausting, debilitating, and sad existence. Addicts are not living; they exist. To live is to thrive, to achieve, and to reach goals. To exist is to wake up every day wishing for a way out of the madness, thinking about all the things lost, and wanting, in some cases, to die. It is the opposite of thriving.


It starts very innocently. Have you ever ‚Äúneeded‚Äù a beer, joint, opioid, or other mind-altering substance to cope with a bad day? Did you enjoy the high you felt? Maybe you‚Äôve had a string of bad days and circumstances happen to you, and you turn back to the substances for the feeling of relaxation‚Äîthat seemingly glorious, carefree feeling. Now try to imagine it's been a consecutive month and you‚Äôve gotten drunk every night, that month turns into two months, you start to run low on funds, and you start to either borrow money to support your habit, or you begin to seek out friends who can support it because they support theirs.

So now you‚Äôve gotten a reputation for hanging out to get high, yet you keep going back because, after all, you are getting high. Getting high is becoming something you need rather than a fun time every once in a while. That is how the slippery slope of addiction starts so many times. Then the vicious cycle continues day after day, month after month, year after year.

There‚Äôs a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/Bbby9nudYfa9kt4E/?mibextid=oFDknk" style="color: black;">compelling post</a> on Facebook that states that trying drugs for the first time is like the most relaxing, freeing feeling in the world, and then it's like losing your house, car, self-respect, kids, and family. I remember the night I smoked my first joint. I felt like I was dreaming while walking around talking to my friends. I swore I‚Äôd never smoke another one until the next day brought its problems, and by nightfall, I was seeking more pot, so I couldn‚Äôt feel the hardship I had gotten myself into. I was 23 years old, and that is how my 24-year run depending on marijuana began.
