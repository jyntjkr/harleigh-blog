When I started smoking marijuana I thought I had found what had been missing in my life. It became my everything, every day, all day friend. I just knew it was the answer to being bipolar, The correct medication to make the symptoms disappear. I felt more like myself, of course, I had no idea who I was at the time. I had never had a day without mood swings. Without the thoughts of wishing my life was different or over. I was so sure I'd never make it past 30. My friend Mary Jane helped me calm down, and slow down the racing thoughts, and constant overthinking. It made me feel carefree about the problems and turmoil, it just made me not care about anything. 


The big debate about marijuana centers on whether it’s a gateway drug or not. I used to say it was the gateway to the fridge jokingly. The truth is, for me, it was the gateway to more alcohol, pills, coke, meth, crack, and shrooms. I was too scared to try any heroin; to be honest I was scared to try anything I did the first time. Once I got over the fear I wasn't scared to take my meds for bipolar, drink a case of beer, and mix Xanax with pot on a nightly basis. I wasn't scared to do uppers and downers at the same time. I wasn't scared to free-base cocaine while snorting Xanax and smoking pot laced with coke. I did meth and made myself look like a fool fighting inanimate objects and people just to forget because I was also snorting Xanax and smoking marijuana. 


I only realized after getting clean 24 years later that marijuana most certainly is a gateway drug, and it is most definitely not the answer to bipolar. Being sober showed me how much pot exacerbated the mood swings and overthinking that come with being bipolar. Yes, you may feel calmer while you're high, but when you come down, it's all there, waiting to spin you out of control again. It forces you to find more of your drugs to make all the chaos in your mind disappear, once again. Have you ever been so sure drugs were helping more than anything else, that you couldn't even hear logic and facts backed by science? That’s how it is for an addict, we're so damn sure the drugs are the answer we can't hear anything else. At least not until the drugs don't even make the chaos stop. It is then that we seek help, some kind of relief found in AA, NA, or counseling. It could even be through a MAT program which offers counseling along with medication to overcome heroin and opioid addiction.
